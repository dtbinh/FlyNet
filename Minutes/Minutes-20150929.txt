Option for VizO / base / autopilot: DJI Guidance solution on Matrice 100
Does not give us lighting condition option
Provides an out-of-the box solution for VizO

Discussed with Frew, not with Zohaib - 
Big tradeoff - no function in low light

Options: 
Matrice base w/ Guidance
Other base w/ Guidance

Guidance already has ROS integration - limits with imaging output

Discussed relative merits of the Matrice vs a smaller platform
Matrice will be cutting it close to get through doors
Comparison of the trade space between custom vs Matrice platforms
Matrice represents a large chunk of budget

Contact with Zohaib this week is via email or call by Drew and Austin
Requirements / preferences to be email to Zohaib today
