% Your goal is to create your own version of the file ControllerExample
% that actually calculates desired velocities (the current one that I made
% is broken since the calc_desired_velocities function does nothing). Then
% I want you to plot the desired velocities as a function of time in this
% function using the data in the variable poseData, which contains x-y
% positions over time (the code for this already exists below). Start by
% copying the ControllerExample code into a new script and saving it as
% ControllerLastName, i.e. Drew's would be ControllerEllison. Then edit
% anything you see fit to get the controller to work. Once you get it to
% work, feel free to tune the controller.
