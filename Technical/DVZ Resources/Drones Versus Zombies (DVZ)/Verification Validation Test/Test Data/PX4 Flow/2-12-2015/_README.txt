SUMMARY FROM ALL TESTS:
Alright everyone,

So Nathan and I have just completed about 20 or so test runs with the flow in the Lockheed Martin hallway. 
We started with baseline tests where nothing was added to the environment and the results were as we expected 
which is that none of the movement was captured. Then we moved down to the mechanical engineering side where 
the carpet is and found the same results. Next we acquired a construction light setup from Matt and went about 
redoing the tests. This time we saw a bit of improvement which is to say that it would realize that it was 
moving for short spurts but not the whole time. Bobby then gave us carpet tiles to use so that we could test 
out whether or not it was a lack of feature issue. We found that the carpet helped a lot about that we could 
track almost as well as we can in vicon when the light is shown directly at the area where we are testing. 
Without the light is does not pick up the movement.

Nathan and I would be happy to go through our results with everyone but at this time using the flow in 
the lockheed martin hallway is not a good option. It might be possible to make it work but the environment 
would have to be adapted. 

Thanks,
Ben
