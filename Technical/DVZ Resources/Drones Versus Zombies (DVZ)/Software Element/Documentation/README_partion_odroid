In order to partition the ODROID, plug eMMC module into cerebro by:
1. connect eMMC module to eMMC to micro-SD connecor
2. insert eMMC-to-microSD connector into micro-SD to SD connector
3. insert SD card into SD reader on cerebro

Next open GPARTED on cerebro. Select disk corresponding to the eMMC module. In oder to determine the disk corresponding to the eMMC module:
1. in a terminal type
   $ lsblk
the output should look like something like:
NAME   MAJ:MIN  RM    SIZE  RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0     0  465.8G   0 disk
|-       8:1     0    462G   0 part /
sdb      8:0     0   15.6G   0 disk

choose the disk corresponding that is consistent with the size of the eMMC module. For a 16GB eMMC module that would correspond to sdb in the above example.

In GPARTED select the appropriate disk. Then select Rezise/Move from the toolbar at the top. Once prompted to resize the partition drag the bar until it utilizes the rest of the eMMC module. Finally, click "Apply" and wait until it is finished resizing the partition.
