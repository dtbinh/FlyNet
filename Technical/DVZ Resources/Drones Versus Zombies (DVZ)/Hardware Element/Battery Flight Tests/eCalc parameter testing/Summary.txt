Test Summary:

This testing was done to gain a better model of the X8 quad parameters to be used in eCalc. 
Two flights were performed (at two different AUW) where voltage and current were recorded.
To get a more reliable eCalc prediction, parameters in eCalc such as prop efficiency and battery voltage were 
adjusted so that the eCalc predicted and actual current and voltage measurements were the same. 

Later Results:
In doing this, the ecalc model was closer to actual results, but still overestimated flight time. 
Since this test was done, eCalc has been updated to work for bi-axial motor setups like the X8 and so this may provide better results.
