% Summary of test:

This test was done to verify that 4S Lipo batteries are able to be used on the 2013 X8. 

The matlab program plots data from a test flight using a 4S battery to ensure that maximum allowable power for motors and esc's was not exceeded.
Prior to this test 4S Lipo batteries were thought to possibly be the cause of earlier ESC and Motor failures.
The quad was flown manually and flown more harshly than normal autonomous operation expectations.
The results show that the 2013 X8 is compatible with 4S Lipo batteries. Since this test, 4S batteries have 
been used on the X8 regularly and cause no problems.
