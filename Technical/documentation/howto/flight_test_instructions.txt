Flight Test Procedure for Odroid:
----------------------------------
1. ssh into odroid:
odroid@flynet01
password:
odroid

2. Run source devel/setup.bash
3. Run from catkin_ws:
$ roslaunch mavros px4.launch
this turns on mavlink on the px4 and starts mavros node and roscore node
4. Run from catkin_ws:
 $ rosrun ros_vrpn_client ros_vrpn_client __name:=Terminator _vrpn_server_ip:=192.168.20.100
use Terminator for our quad. This starts the ros_vrpn_client node.
5. Run from catkin_ws:
 $ rosrun vicon_repeater_node vicon_repeater_node
This will start publishing the vicon data to the pixhawk's position_estimator_inav module
6. Run from catkin_ws:
 $ rosrun px4_intf_node px4_flynet_node
This will try to force the quad into offboard mode, force it to guided, and force it to arm. 
It will also publish position setpoints to the quad to it's mc_pos_control module. 
This is the final ros program to run. 

To Takeoff:
------------
1. Pilot has switch 5 in up position (MANUAL override mode)
2. Pilot arms quad by pushing throttle down/right until beep is heard.
3. Pilot tests motors manually
4. Once satisfied, pilot can force automatic behavior by switching switch 5 to down position (OFFBOARD mode)

To Land:
--------
Pilot must perform manual landing by:
1. Take control of quad by switching switch 5 back to up position (MANUAL override mode).
2. Pilot gently lands quad.
3. Pilot disarms motors by pushing throttle down/left until beep is heard. 
4. Any bag files should be transfered off the quad. 
5. Once transfer of data is complete, run soft shutdown on odroid:
$ sudo shutdown -h now
6. Once lights on Odroid stop blinking, battery can be disconnected. 

Topics to Monitor/Record During Flight:
----------------------------------------
/mavros/state -> Look for Arm State/Guided Enabled/OFFBOARD vs MANUAL modes
/Terminator/pose -> Look at vicon reported position/orientation 
/mavros/local_position/local -> Confirm Mavros pose/orientation estimates are reasonable (make sure z is not -16 m)
/mavros/rc/out -> Look at raw motor commands, ~1100 is low throttle ~1900 is high throttle
/mavros/setpoint_position/local -> Make sure our setpoints are what they're supposed to be
