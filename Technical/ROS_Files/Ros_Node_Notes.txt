Ros Node Notes:
----------------
Publish/Subscriber Node:
-------------------------
So we can write a publisher and subscriber, 
specify loop rates. Etc. See:

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29

So you can use catkin tools to generate build lists and what not. 

These just constantly publish/subscribe to running streams of info. 
Publisher tightly describes what's being published while subscriber 
runs a callback function on what's being subscribed to. 

Service/Client Node:
---------------------
Services are based on call response, you can define a structure of them.
Available services get advertised. 
Clients can then be created that use the advertised services. 

Async Spinner 
-> use this for subscriber
